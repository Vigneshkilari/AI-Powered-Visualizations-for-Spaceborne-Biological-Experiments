# AI-Powered-Visualizations-for-Spaceborne-Biological-Experiments
This repository hosts an AI-powered tool for generating dynamic visualizations of spaceborne biological experiments. Using Generative AI, it processes data from NASA's Open Science Data Repository, including Rodent Research-1 (OSD-379) and Rodent Research-23 (OSD-665), providing interactive graphical abstracts for researchers.
